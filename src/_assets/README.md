## Assets

This assets folder is used for demo assets like image or movie files inside component previews. 
The folder gets copied to the distribution folder without any transformations and should never be used within the target CMS!

> Be aware that this folder should NOT contain page relevant data for components like icons or company logos! Please move files like that to `/resources/img` or `/resources/icons`
